Aruco Placement Section

You work in a firm where they have a specific department, to autonomously put aruco markers on square boxes. Your task is to write a python code, for finding square boxes in an image and then place aruco markers exactly overlapping on it with the following rules.

                     Green                                                                                              1

            The aruco markers should exactly be placed on the squares only, even the orientation of the square should be kept in mind.
 so finally successfully I have put the aruco marker on the top of the specific square.
